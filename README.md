## Project Title
**Web Application for PDF Analysis using Langchain and Hugging Face**

## Description
This web application allows users to upload PDF files and receive responses based on the content of the PDF combined with a language model's understanding. The application leverages Langchain for document processing and Hugging Face's language models to generate insightful responses.

## Features
- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload PDF files for analysis.
- **Content Analysis:** The application extracts text from the PDF and processes it using Langchain.
- **LLM Integration:** Utilizes Hugging Face's language models to generate responses based on the extracted text.
- **Interactive Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the application and receive responses.

## Technologies Used
- **Langchain:** A framework for building applications with language models. It facilitates the extraction and processing of text data from documents.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** A library providing state-of-the-art machine learning models for natural language processing tasks. It is used here to generate responses based on the processed text.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the backend of the application.
- **Flask/Django (or your chosen framework):** The web framework used to build the application interface and handle requests.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Technologies used to create the front-end interface of the application.
